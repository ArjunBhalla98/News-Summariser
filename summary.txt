Microsoft is suing a mysterious North Korean hacking group for allegedly stealing "highly sensitive information" from computers in the United States. A new lawsuit targets two unnamed people who Microsoft (MSFT) claims work for Thallium, which the suit describes as a "cybertheft operation" that has worked to gain access to "high-value" computer networks. Thallium targeted government employees, think tanks, university staff and members of groups that work on issues including nuclear proliferation and human rights, the complaint states.
