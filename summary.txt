A new lawsuit targets two unnamed people who Microsoft (MSFT) claims work for Thallium, which the suit describes as a "cybertheft operation" that has worked to gain access to "high-value" computer networks. It also wants compensation for damages in "an amount to be proven at trial." Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The emails attempt to lure users into providing login information by claiming that suspicious activity was identified on their accounts. The suit was filed in a federal court in Virginia because Thallium uses internet domains registered in the state, according to court filings.
